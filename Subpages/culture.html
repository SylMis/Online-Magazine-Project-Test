            <p class="first_p">Japanese culture is not only known from the manga, anime or computer games but also from the martial arts such as karate. We can find this sport everywhere in that country, in literature, movies or daily lifestyle. But Japan is not only place where we can find it.  Let’s have a look where you should look for inspiration if you wanna get to know world of karate.

            <h3 class="article_subtitle">Raise up your hands, they need your energy!
            </h3>

                <p class="article_text">Let’s start with not very popular and obvious for everyone anime. „Anime (pronounced AH-nee-may ) is a term for a style of Japanese comic book and video cartoon animation in which the main characters have large doe-like eyes. Anime is the prevalent style in Japanese comic books or manga.” <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/anime"><b>Read more...</b></a></p>

                <p class="article_text">
                It is obvious that Japanese people love their culture and they are masters in making anime, so going ahead it is obvious they not only use karate in their stories, they also produce stories about just karate. We can find many titles, such as <i>Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple</i>, <i>Dragon Ball Z</i>  or <i>Naruto</i></p>

                <p class="article_text">
                Many kids both in Japan and in the western were raised on these titles. You can think it is not very good for society or especially for kids because it teaches fights, brutality and other „bad” things. But that is not true. Those anime actually shows how to be loyal, not give  up and strive for your dreams.That is because these are the main premisses of the karate code, which is <a href="bushido.html"><b>bushi-do</b></a>.
                </p>


                <h3 class="article_subtitle">Karate in movies</h3>

                <p class="article_text">Another part of Japanese culture are movies. The most popular kinds from the land of cherry blossoms are action-movies. That is the main source for western world from which it is able to get to know culture of asian martial arts.</p>

                <p class="article_text">
                But also in western cinematographic we are able to find many karate-inspirations. It is worth mentioning here such titles as <i>Karate Kid</i> or an amazing movie with Jean Claude Van Damme like  <i>Kickboxer</i>.</p>

                 It is very important, especially nowadays to be able recognize some parts of different cultures. It helps us understand people from all over the World and also how actually this World works.  It’s very interesting to watch eastern cultures in a Western cinema. You cannot only learn something about the culture of another country but also see how much culture data are different.
            </p>

                <p class="article_text">
                If you are going to country like Japan, you definitely should watch some Japanese movies or at least get to know Japanese culture from other sources like books, anime or even stories different people. That way you will be more confident and aware of what is around you while walking through streets of Tokyo, Kyoto or any other city.
