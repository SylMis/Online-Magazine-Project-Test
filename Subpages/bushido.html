            A country that may seem abstract to some people every year attracts millions of tourists who want to experience this amazing culture with their whole body and their whole soul. </p>

            <p class="article_text">
            If you think about it more deeply, you can see a beautiful paradox about the fact that Japan, probably the most technologically advanced country, owes its success to the principles that have been in Japanese culture since the dawn of history and which are still obvious to the spirit of modern Japan.</p>

            <h3 class="article_subtitle">Extraordinary Paradox
            </h3>

            <p class="article_text">
            I’ll start by explaining what bushido is. <i> „Bushido was the code of conduct for Japan’s warrior classes from perhaps as early as the eighth century through modern times. The word „bushido” comes from the Japanese roots „bushi” meaning „warrior,” and „do” meaning „path” or „way.” It translates literally to „way of the warrior.””</i>More to read about it <a href="hrefhttps://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-"><b>here</b></a>.
            </p>

            <p class="article_text">
            The Bushido Code came into use only in the 16th century, but its history goes back much earlier. Samurai have served and helped their masters since the ninth century.  The Code was recognized as a method of improving both body and spirit. He talked about virtues such as loyalty, modesty and honor.
            </p>

            <p class="article_text">Interestingly, Bushido content has never been written. It has always been passed down from generation to generation. Perhaps that is why it is so important for the Japanese and an indispensable part of their culture.</p>

            <ol class="list">
                <li>GI 義 Rectitude or Justice - the basic rule that defines the character of a warrior
                </li>
                 <li>YUUKI 勇気 Courage - Yuu means courage, heroism, while ki can be translated as mind or spirit. Yuuki is therefore courage and bravery, which not only manifest in the actions of the warrior, but are the natural state of his mind.
                </li>
                <li> JIN 仁  Benevolence or Mercy - As a samurai warrior, he was supposed to defend the weak and the oppressed. Mercy and respect belonged to everyone, including opponents.
                </li>
                <li>REI 礼 Kindness - Samurai should be a role model for others, not just on the battlefield. Rei is respect for the feelings of others, kindness and modesty.
                </li>
                <li>MAKOTO 誠 Honesty and Sincerity - Truthfulness was more important than courtesy and etiquette. It was total fidelity to truth that distinguished warriors from the rest of society.
                </li>
                <li>MEIYO 名誉 Honor - This was the supreme value in the life of a warrior. Honor meant self-respect and loyalty to one’s own ideals. The loss of honor was worse than death for a warrior and often resulted in the decision to commit the ritual suicide of seppuku.
                </li>
                <li>
                CHUUGI 忠義 Loyalty -  Chuu means to be loyal, while the sign of heart contained in it speaks of the values hidden in the soul, which should be followed by a samurai.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="article_subtitle">The beauty of Japanese Samurai virtues
            </h3>

             <p class="article_text">It seems to me that it is through Bushido and the message that it carries to this day among the Japanese community that this country is so successful. The virtues that historical samurai professed to this day are the basis of social life in the land of cherry blossoms. That is why the Japanese are so disciplined, polite, helpful and hard-working.</p>

            <p class="article_text">In Europe, we also have our „bushido” - it is the knightly ethos. But being completely honest, I don’t think it exists in the minds of young Europeans. I bet most of them don’t even know what it is. That is why the samurai code is so fascinating. It has survived several hundreds in an unsaved form, and yet it still shapes the characters of the island’s inhabitants.</p>
